# BurgerKenzie

In this academic project, I developed a burger joint application using React and TypeScript. The website has several features to provide a better user experience.

On the login screen, the user can sign up and log in to their account to access the application features.

The home page presents a selection of available products, allowing the user to add and remove items from the cart. To avoid item duplication, the application allows adding only one product per ID.

Currently, the application does not display an item counter in the cart, but this functionality will be added in the future.

With these features, the application aims to offer a more intuitive and easy shopping experience to users, allowing them to find the products they want and manage their carts with ease.

I'm excited about the project and I hope you like it too! Check out the login and home screen images below.
